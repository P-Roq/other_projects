There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here.

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit.

I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Queen succeeded - despite all the vicissitudes of her family's dynamics - in sustaining the project of constitutional monarchy in post-war Britain. Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.</td>\n",

I was listening to leftist folk singer Pete Seeger, who originally opposed american participation in fighting the Nazis. “Roosevelt told the people how he felt… I hate war and so does elanor but we won’t be safe til everybody’s dead”. And for the most part, in most wars. I agree. But not in fighting the reich. that was an all hands on deck job. Or— if a civil war were to break out, as some think, when would I feel it important to upkeep democracy? I would love to hear your thoughts on “the line” of anti war beliefs. when is the able bodied public meant to volunteer? when are the professionals meant to shift all focus to solving or stopping conflict? And most importantly— what can academics /do/ to preserve or change during conflict?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless. It was unfair, too, in that it reduced her to a ridiculous caricature of the \"problem white woman\" without any investigation into who she was, as a person.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess that all this is to say that we suffer from the same disease, over here. There are some differences, in terms of progression, but our current version of the right and some of our left is completely infected, or so it seems to me. And that is to my considerable dismay... because yea, Canada is a bit special. How many countries work for decades, even up to centuries, to build an intentional dream of inclusion like that? It's not something so little that we should just think nothing about tearing off bits or even throwing it away. \\n\\nNo, rather I think it's grand, and I mean that in both languages and in all possible senses of the word.</td>\n",

You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country.

My main impression is that there's a disconnect between the beliefs and the feelings, at least for me.\\n\\nI take for granted that institutions have limited competence; that regulatory capture is a real and significant phenomenon, especially in areas such as financial regulation; that I'm not a major donor, nor a swing voter, nor registered in a swing state or district, nor socially linked to a large number of people I could influence, and that I therefore have, if not zero influence, at least substantially less influence on policymakers than my numerical position as one citizen among 300,000,000+ would suggest; and that an adequate understanding of the behavior of institutions would require an as-yet undeveloped collection of theory and data, like economics only harder.  But somehow, I do not feel that set of beliefs emotionally, nor do act on it.  I still participate in the liturgy of democracy, despite not believing the creed.  I write to my elected representatives.  I sometimes go to campaign events during the primaries, and speak to the candidate if I get the chance.  I go to my polling place every election day, speak to the people outside with signs and pamphlets, and listen with particular attention to races where I'm not thoroughly decided.

       "      <td>The Queen succeeded - despite all the vicissitudes of her family's dynamics - in sustaining the project of constitutional monarchy in post-war Britain. Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.</td>\n",

Battles which seem to have eliminated all sense of unity in our citizens.

No fighting about the results. No protests. No Coup attempts. \\n     When Queen Elizabeth died the Countries, the Commonwealth, all who were under her care, came together to mourn. Obviously some people felt more deeply emotional than others. But there was not one report of any group who felt relief that she had passed.

       "      <td>Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless.

       "      <td>The Queen succeeded - despite all the vicissitudes of her family's dynamics - in sustaining the project of constitutional monarchy in post-war Britain. Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless. It was unfair, too, in that it reduced her to a ridiculous caricature of the \"problem white woman\" without any investigation into who she was, as a person.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess that all this is to say that we suffer from the same disease, over here. There are some differences, in terms of progression, but our current version of the right and some of our left is completely infected, or so it seems to me. And that is to my considerable dismay... because yea, Canada is a bit special. How many countries work for decades, even up to centuries, to build an intentional dream of inclusion like that? It's not something so little that we should just think nothing about tearing off bits or even throwing it away. \\n\\nNo, rather I think it's grand, and I mean that in both languages and in all possible senses of the word.</td>\n",

Hers is an extraordinary history. There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here. As well as mention that the BBC, a great institution that in many ways is vulnerable and at risk, is doing a fantastic job with coverage today.  \n",

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit. We've descended into the \"so, you think you're better than me?\" society where so much means so little to so many.\\n\\nOne question, Vlad, if I may? You used the phrase 'our culture' and all citizens -- do you think there is a shared single culture, even shared values in Britain today? Was that a generalisation? It's just not what I have found in 52 years, sadly.  \n",

Out of curiosity he went to a music hall, in South London. The theatre was full to capacity, the audience largely from the poorer classes. They were singing all the old songs and laughing along in good spirits. He had wondered how an unprepared democracy could resist a totalitarian state. In that moment he realised why they had prevailed . The sense of good hearted solidarity, struck him as a young communist and he made his home here.  \n",

Even the concept of \"important national leaders\" seems strange to me. If you ask me who our head of state is, I always have to think for a second or two which one of the seven members of the federal council it is. Because they take turn every year. Swiss politics is boring as hell in a good way. We almost have no really disruptive power changes, no single ruling party. Also no significant losses of certain national figures, that could shake the whole country.  \n",

It’s telling when you rarely pay much attention and aren’t a royalist. But on hearing the news you feel strangely sad and unsettled. Which is why I like your conversations so much- they bring things to the fore.  \n",

The Queen for me was the perfect symbol of national unity beyond politics and the right sense of duty and political silence that is the requirement of a constitutional monarch. My proudest inheritance from my father are two plaques: his award of the Polish Virtuti Militari medal his bravery in the War and the post-war commission as a Royal Air Force officer he received from the Queen's father King George VI.\\nWith her passing I feel the huge gap of that departing generation, but I hope her loss will renew interest in a sense of duty to our civilisation which she so embodied, a move away from narcissism and a return to working for the common good. Our national anthem will or course change which will be hard to get used to.\\nNothing is immortal, we have to keep renewing the good things!  \n",

Perhaps I just don’t know the lingo to talk about it yet, but we can talk about issues that affect Black people more without this wall of identity around it. we should do things that help the Black community because they’re our neighbors and that’s what we do. and we can recognize the background. but idk— identity is important but there’s too many barriers all around us now. it’s like a maze with no corridors.  \n",

I'm sorry to see the Queen go - I'm neither an abolitionist or monarchist, I feel that the monarchy while imperfect (cloaked as it is in religiosity and so on) is as good a system as any. I think/hope we in Britain can cohere in a time of need and it would be useful for us to follow the Queen's example in a crisis; to be clearheaded and rational as opposed to being led by emotion.\\n\\nOn your wider point I think I see more and more people with a childlike level of political understanding. You don't have to scroll far through YouTube comments or the \"Have Your Say\" section on the BBC to see hackneyed or cliched political discourse. You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country. This isn't Game of Thrones, this is real life. People need to understand that - as today has proven - rich or poor, urchin or Queen, we all die in the end, and that until that happens we all need somewhere to sleep, food to eat, and our goals in life aren't that dissimilar. Maybe then we could return to some common ground.  \n",

We now live in a different world to the one I was accustoned to and I don't like it. HM her Majesty was for me and many a global symbol of virtue, value, stability, adaptability, compromise and freedom. Long live HM the Queen's memory! Long live her legacy! What an absolutely sad sad day.  \n",

Even as Americans, we can identify with the British in their ambivalence about the institution of the monarchy. And, we are watching as you go through this time and try to sort this out.

Thank you  thank you  thank you \\nIn my opinion, Her Majesty was the sole definition of grace, her honorable behavior was almost flawless and I’ve always admired her ability to stay true to herself, and I think the speech she made to the nation when she was only 21 years old is very telling of the kind of person she was.\\nAnd I can be wrong but I believe she never gave any interviews, her weekly briefings with the 15 different prime minister’s during her reign, who always was unofficial - no notes - no personal opinion never leaked. I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace   \n",

The gradual degradation of the average persons apparent awareness and/or participation in any sense of civic belonging. Any positive regard or expression of being a part of a nation, of something greater, a narrative, dying or gasping for air. Fast approaching 30, I genuinely feel untethered from the world of my youth and upbringing. So much has changed, so quickly. For context, i’m a lower middle class Australian.  \n",

In time we'll be ok, because she hasn't left us as defenceless children, but there is going to be a journey across the desert. God save the King.  \n",

Hers is an extraordinary history. There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here. As well as mention that the BBC, a great institution that in many ways is vulnerable and at risk, is doing a fantastic job with coverage today.  \n",

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit. We've descended into the \"so, you think you're better than me?\" society where so much means so little to so many.\\n\\nOne question, Vlad, if I may? You used the phrase 'our culture' and all citizens -- do you think there is a shared single culture, even shared values in Britain today? Was that a generalisation? It's just not what I have found in 52 years, sadly.  \n",

Out of curiosity he went to a music hall, in South London. The theatre was full to capacity, the audience largely from the poorer classes. They were singing all the old songs and laughing along in good spirits. He had wondered how an unprepared democracy could resist a totalitarian state. In that moment he realised why they had prevailed . The sense of good hearted solidarity, struck him as a young communist and he made his home here.  \n",

Even the concept of \"important national leaders\" seems strange to me. If you ask me who our head of state is, I always have to think for a second or two which one of the seven members of the federal council it is. Because they take turn every year. Swiss politics is boring as hell in a good way. We almost have no really disruptive power changes, no single ruling party. Also no significant losses of certain national figures, that could shake the whole country.  \n",

It’s telling when you rarely pay much attention and aren’t a royalist. But on hearing the news you feel strangely sad and unsettled. Which is why I like your conversations so much- they bring things to the fore.  \n",

The Queen for me was the perfect symbol of national unity beyond politics and the right sense of duty and political silence that is the requirement of a constitutional monarch. My proudest inheritance from my father are two plaques: his award of the Polish Virtuti Militari medal his bravery in the War and the post-war commission as a Royal Air Force officer he received from the Queen's father King George VI.\\nWith her passing I feel the huge gap of that departing generation, but I hope her loss will renew interest in a sense of duty to our civilisation which she so embodied, a move away from narcissism and a return to working for the common good. Our national anthem will or course change which will be hard to get used to.\\nNothing is immortal, we have to keep renewing the good things!  \n",

Perhaps I just don’t know the lingo to talk about it yet, but we can talk about issues that affect Black people more without this wall of identity around it. we should do things that help the Black community because they’re our neighbors and that’s what we do. and we can recognize the background. but idk— identity is important but there’s too many barriers all around us now. it’s like a maze with no corridors.  \n",

I'm sorry to see the Queen go - I'm neither an abolitionist or monarchist, I feel that the monarchy while imperfect (cloaked as it is in religiosity and so on) is as good a system as any. I think/hope we in Britain can cohere in a time of need and it would be useful for us to follow the Queen's example in a crisis; to be clearheaded and rational as opposed to being led by emotion.\\n\\nOn your wider point I think I see more and more people with a childlike level of political understanding. You don't have to scroll far through YouTube comments or the \"Have Your Say\" section on the BBC to see hackneyed or cliched political discourse. You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country. This isn't Game of Thrones, this is real life. People need to understand that - as today has proven - rich or poor, urchin or Queen, we all die in the end, and that until that happens we all need somewhere to sleep, food to eat, and our goals in life aren't that dissimilar. Maybe then we could return to some common ground.  \n",

We now live in a different world to the one I was accustoned to and I don't like it. HM her Majesty was for me and many a global symbol of virtue, value, stability, adaptability, compromise and freedom. Long live HM the Queen's memory! Long live her legacy! What an absolutely sad sad day.  \n",

Even as Americans, we can identify with the British in their ambivalence about the institution of the monarchy. And, we are watching as you go through this time and try to sort this out.

Thank you  thank you  thank you \\nIn my opinion, Her Majesty was the sole definition of grace, her honorable behavior was almost flawless and I’ve always admired her ability to stay true to herself, and I think the speech she made to the nation when she was only 21 years old is very telling of the kind of person she was.\\nAnd I can be wrong but I believe she never gave any interviews, her weekly briefings with the 15 different prime minister’s during her reign, who always was unofficial - no notes - no personal opinion never leaked. I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace   \n",

The gradual degradation of the average persons apparent awareness and/or participation in any sense of civic belonging. Any positive regard or expression of being a part of a nation, of something greater, a narrative, dying or gasping for air. Fast approaching 30, I genuinely feel untethered from the world of my youth and upbringing. So much has changed, so quickly. For context, i’m a lower middle class Australian.  \n",

In time we'll be ok, because she hasn't left us as defenceless children, but there is going to be a journey across the desert. God save the King.  \n",

There is this vision of stabilty she personified based on centuries of history and based on her actions and behaviour. In that regard, she was deifinitely a stabilizing force in symbol, but at the same time, an anachronism. I'm in Canada and she's part of tradition and the Queen of Canada, but at the same time, representative of something that is so foreign in this country. I'm not sure if the idea of a 'republic' is any answer, as that will come up in the coming weeks I'm sure. Would it be better or just a renaming of heirarchical structures? Is there really a difference? \\n\\nI grew up singing God Save the Queen in public school, then suddenly not.  \n",

Should we be optimistic or rather pessimistic about the (already happening) changes in the western societies? Word \"crisis\" paired with anything brings negative connotations but also some kind of hope that things may be improved afterwards, an unstable world may become stable again. Or maybe the (ongoing) crisis is just a new form of existence of the western world, with no perspective of happy end?  \n",

She was, he said , a moral code,  a guiding light on how to behave. If ever we badly needed a guiding light, it is now.  \n",

My main impression is that there's a disconnect between the beliefs and the feelings, at least for me.\\n\\nI take for granted that institutions have limited competence; that regulatory capture is a real and significant phenomenon, especially in areas such as financial regulation; that I'm not a major donor, nor a swing voter, nor registered in a swing state or district, nor socially linked to a large number of people I could influence, and that I therefore have, if not zero influence, at least substantially less influence on policymakers than my numerical position as one citizen among 300,000,000+ would suggest; and that an adequate understanding of the behavior of institutions would require an as-yet undeveloped collection of theory and data, like economics only harder.  But somehow, I do not feel that set of beliefs emotionally, nor do act on it.  I still participate in the liturgy of democracy, despite not believing the creed.  I write to my elected representatives.  I sometimes go to campaign events during the primaries, and speak to the candidate if I get the chance.  I go to my polling place every election day, speak to the people outside with signs and pamphlets, and listen with particular attention to races where I'm not thoroughly decided.  I thank them for being there.  I vote.  \n",

They NEVER call her that. Good video. I think this throws the future of the monarchy in to significant jeopardy. The current PM at one point in her career of political flip-flopping, advocated for the abolishment of the monarchy. I'm not a pro-monarchy type guy at all but I appreciate the notion that the Queen was a symbol for unification. I personally am not sure Charles will ever be able to earn the trust or respect that his mother had.  And the following generation of royals are little more than minor celebrities at this point. Irrespective of public opinion I think it is fair to say the Royal family has done quite well at diluting its own significance. So yes, interesting times ahead.  \n",

As ever, a joy to listen to.   Can you develop the phrase \"anti-solidarity propaganda\" a little further?   I'm interested to know whether your view is that this propaganda is different from propaganda of the sort described by Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (for example), and if so, in what way(s). \\nAs always, a pleasure to listen to - thank you.     .  \n",

Yeah, in a while - there's a visceral component in play at the moment. We lost our horsey girl, and the wilderness loving walker. Many are saying; The last respectable royal has passed. I have issue with a lot of things about the monarchy - and spent half my life in different countries that I have happily called home, but this still hurts.

Hers is an extraordinary history. There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here. As well as mention that the BBC, a great institution that in many ways is vulnerable and at risk, is doing a fantastic job with coverage today.  \n",

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit. We've descended into the \"so, you think you're better than me?\" society where so much means so little to so many.\\n\\nOne question, Vlad, if I may? You used the phrase 'our culture' and all citizens -- do you think there is a shared single culture, even shared values in Britain today? Was that a generalisation? It's just not what I have found in 52 years, sadly.  \n",

Out of curiosity he went to a music hall, in South London. The theatre was full to capacity, the audience largely from the poorer classes. They were singing all the old songs and laughing along in good spirits. He had wondered how an unprepared democracy could resist a totalitarian state. In that moment he realised why they had prevailed . The sense of good hearted solidarity, struck him as a young communist and he made his home here.  \n",

Even the concept of \"important national leaders\" seems strange to me. If you ask me who our head of state is, I always have to think for a second or two which one of the seven members of the federal council it is. Because they take turn every year. Swiss politics is boring as hell in a good way. We almost have no really disruptive power changes, no single ruling party. Also no significant losses of certain national figures, that could shake the whole country.  \n",

It’s telling when you rarely pay much attention and aren’t a royalist. But on hearing the news you feel strangely sad and unsettled. Which is why I like your conversations so much- they bring things to the fore.  \n",

The Queen for me was the perfect symbol of national unity beyond politics and the right sense of duty and political silence that is the requirement of a constitutional monarch. My proudest inheritance from my father are two plaques: his award of the Polish Virtuti Militari medal his bravery in the War and the post-war commission as a Royal Air Force officer he received from the Queen's father King George VI.\\nWith her passing I feel the huge gap of that departing generation, but I hope her loss will renew interest in a sense of duty to our civilisation which she so embodied, a move away from narcissism and a return to working for the common good. Our national anthem will or course change which will be hard to get used to.\\nNothing is immortal, we have to keep renewing the good things!  \n",

Perhaps I just don’t know the lingo to talk about it yet, but we can talk about issues that affect Black people more without this wall of identity around it. we should do things that help the Black community because they’re our neighbors and that’s what we do. and we can recognize the background. but idk— identity is important but there’s too many barriers all around us now. it’s like a maze with no corridors.  \n",

I'm sorry to see the Queen go - I'm neither an abolitionist or monarchist, I feel that the monarchy while imperfect (cloaked as it is in religiosity and so on) is as good a system as any. I think/hope we in Britain can cohere in a time of need and it would be useful for us to follow the Queen's example in a crisis; to be clearheaded and rational as opposed to being led by emotion.\\n\\nOn your wider point I think I see more and more people with a childlike level of political understanding. You don't have to scroll far through YouTube comments or the \"Have Your Say\" section on the BBC to see hackneyed or cliched political discourse. You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country. This isn't Game of Thrones, this is real life. People need to understand that - as today has proven - rich or poor, urchin or Queen, we all die in the end, and that until that happens we all need somewhere to sleep, food to eat, and our goals in life aren't that dissimilar. Maybe then we could return to some common ground.  \n",

We now live in a different world to the one I was accustoned to and I don't like it. HM her Majesty was for me and many a global symbol of virtue, value, stability, adaptability, compromise and freedom. Long live HM the Queen's memory! Long live her legacy! What an absolutely sad sad day.  \n",

Even as Americans, we can identify with the British in their ambivalence about the institution of the monarchy. And, we are watching as you go through this time and try to sort this out.

Thank you  thank you  thank you \\nIn my opinion, Her Majesty was the sole definition of grace, her honorable behavior was almost flawless and I’ve always admired her ability to stay true to herself, and I think the speech she made to the nation when she was only 21 years old is very telling of the kind of person she was.\\nAnd I can be wrong but I believe she never gave any interviews, her weekly briefings with the 15 different prime minister’s during her reign, who always was unofficial - no notes - no personal opinion never leaked. I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace   \n",

The gradual degradation of the average persons apparent awareness and/or participation in any sense of civic belonging. Any positive regard or expression of being a part of a nation, of something greater, a narrative, dying or gasping for air. Fast approaching 30, I genuinely feel untethered from the world of my youth and upbringing. So much has changed, so quickly. For context, i’m a lower middle class Australian.  \n",

In time we'll be ok, because she hasn't left us as defenceless children, but there is going to be a journey across the desert. God save the King.  \n",

There is this vision of stabilty she personified based on centuries of history and based on her actions and behaviour. In that regard, she was deifinitely a stabilizing force in symbol, but at the same time, an anachronism. I'm in Canada and she's part of tradition and the Queen of Canada, but at the same time, representative of something that is so foreign in this country. I'm not sure if the idea of a 'republic' is any answer, as that will come up in the coming weeks I'm sure. Would it be better or just a renaming of heirarchical structures? Is there really a difference? \\n\\nI grew up singing God Save the Queen in public school, then suddenly not.  \n",

Should we be optimistic or rather pessimistic about the (already happening) changes in the western societies? Word \"crisis\" paired with anything brings negative connotations but also some kind of hope that things may be improved afterwards, an unstable world may become stable again. Or maybe the (ongoing) crisis is just a new form of existence of the western world, with no perspective of happy end?  \n",

She was, he said , a moral code,  a guiding light on how to behave. If ever we badly needed a guiding light, it is now.  \n",

My main impression is that there's a disconnect between the beliefs and the feelings, at least for me.\\n\\nI take for granted that institutions have limited competence; that regulatory capture is a real and significant phenomenon, especially in areas such as financial regulation; that I'm not a major donor, nor a swing voter, nor registered in a swing state or district, nor socially linked to a large number of people I could influence, and that I therefore have, if not zero influence, at least substantially less influence on policymakers than my numerical position as one citizen among 300,000,000+ would suggest; and that an adequate understanding of the behavior of institutions would require an as-yet undeveloped collection of theory and data, like economics only harder.  But somehow, I do not feel that set of beliefs emotionally, nor do act on it.  I still participate in the liturgy of democracy, despite not believing the creed.  I write to my elected representatives.  I sometimes go to campaign events during the primaries, and speak to the candidate if I get the chance.  I go to my polling place every election day, speak to the people outside with signs and pamphlets, and listen with particular attention to races where I'm not thoroughly decided.  I thank them for being there.  I vote.  \n",

They NEVER call her that. Good video. I think this throws the future of the monarchy in to significant jeopardy. The current PM at one point in her career of political flip-flopping, advocated for the abolishment of the monarchy. I'm not a pro-monarchy type guy at all but I appreciate the notion that the Queen was a symbol for unification. I personally am not sure Charles will ever be able to earn the trust or respect that his mother had.  And the following generation of royals are little more than minor celebrities at this point. Irrespective of public opinion I think it is fair to say the Royal family has done quite well at diluting its own significance. So yes, interesting times ahead.  \n",

As ever, a joy to listen to.   Can you develop the phrase \"anti-solidarity propaganda\" a little further?   I'm interested to know whether your view is that this propaganda is different from propaganda of the sort described by Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (for example), and if so, in what way(s). \\nAs always, a pleasure to listen to - thank you.     .  \n",

Yeah, in a while - there's a visceral component in play at the moment. We lost our horsey girl, and the wilderness loving walker. Many are saying; The last respectable royal has passed. I have issue with a lot of things about the monarchy - and spent half my life in different countries that I have happily called home, but this still hurts.

I do wonder if the UK royal family can survive or become some fancy Kardashian family...  \n",

Until we return to viewing others as individuals, and not just members of arbitrarily - and artificially - defined groups, we will make no progress toward solidarity.  \n",

The components of the construct that yielded its artistic effect, its inclusions, exclusions, emphases, neglects, patches, replacements, re-thinkings, betrayals, vindications,  and, yes, its susceptibilities to wrongful exploitation, have been pitilessly disclosed. \\nThe disclosures have been emerging throughout the epoch, some slowly and some suddenly over the duration. Still, the connection has more or less held up between it and the realities which it has interpreted for us. \\nI hope we can fashion some new tools or instruments or strategies that can disclose some factors of the succeeding circumstances that can be useful for fashioning a new solidarity that people can share on a wider scale than is offered at present. And I hope that what is to come can counter the decline which we are manifestly experiencing now. \\nBut, as you suggest, pining for the restoration of some version of the older settlement is, understandably but nevertheless truthfully, only nostalgia.  \n",

Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.  \n",

I can't immediately recall any UK politicians arguing from the principle you mention for example. \\n\\nRegarding hidden intents behind the FSB's explanation for Daria's murder, I find thinking about and searching for such hidden intents can be quite wearing on the brain, don't you? I suppose it is an instance of psychosocial warfare after all (is that a word?!). BTW, I've heard it claimed that the level of suspicion of others necessary to be successfully self-employed over a lifetime can contribute to the risk of dementia symptoms!  \n",

For me, it is about self-entitlement, both on the so called left and right.  With self-entitlement comes uncritical political certainty, isolation and ultimately, alienation. For example, at one time I could read the Guardian and the Telegraph and the only major difference was the editorial page. Now it seems that they are written by different species. I can't read either.  \n",

But I've been watching many of the recent events surrounding the death of the Queen. The protocols, the processes, in an attempt to understand the meaning of the traditions and the reactions of the people in the Realms where she carried soft power. We have no one to compare her to in the US.\\n     I observed the removal and replacement of the person serving in their highest political position. All the fights between political parties with their strongly held opposing views. I compared that to how we in America deal with our own political party battles. Battles which seem to have eliminated all sense of unity in our citizens. Nothing is holding us together as one Nation.\\n     Two days before the Queen's death she performed her last official act by the ceremony to sanctify the transition of power on to their newly elected Prime Minister. No fighting about the results. No protests. No Coup attempts. \\n     When Queen Elizabeth died the Countries, the Commonwealth, all who were under her care, came together to mourn. Obviously some people felt more deeply emotional than others. But there was not one report of any group who felt relief that she had passed. She was THEIR Queen!\\n     In America we have nothing that holds our heart and soul together like their Sovereign does for them.  A \"Leading Family\" they, consciously or not, do turn to for stability. An imperfect family with flaws and talents they can be criticized or praised. But they are loved.\\n    The English Monarchy is bound by established Royal constraints, traditions and pomp and circumstance that has no political agenda. They have no control over agendas that affect the daily lives of the citizens. \\n     Working Royals spend their lives on bringing their people together. And importantly representing them with their respected titles for Great Britain as Ambassadors to the World  \\n     We have nothing to offer the World with that highest level of Ambassadorship. We have no one that could bring us together, putting aside every political bias, in order to honor them. \\n     It makes for an interesting and  valid argument for the necessity of Royalty in a Country. Though it would be impossible for the US to establish a Royal Family here.\\n     I just had this realization since the Queen's death was announced and I was quite surprised how it readjusted some of my American beliefs. And our needs. The Constitution was supposed to be what we all came together to agreed upon. \\n     But it's now shaking with all the attacks from the Republican Party. And would crumble completely if Trump went back into office.

This will have a psychological effect. \\n\\nHaving watched The Queen it has become clear to me what a social adhesive the royal institution is in the UK. Not great that the new king is a lot less popular. Maybe it would have been better if it was William.  \n",

It’s hard to talk about this fear without feeling like i’m contributing to paranoia, though. I have been thinking about my duty to freedom and liberty, and where i draw the line before i feel i need to act. I was listening to leftist folk singer Pete Seeger, who originally opposed american participation in fighting the Nazis. “Roosevelt told the people how he felt… I hate war and so does elanor but we won’t be safe til everybody’s dead”. And for the most part, in most wars. I agree. But not in fighting the reich. that was an all hands on deck job. Or— if a civil war were to break out, as some think, when would I feel it important to upkeep democracy? I would love to hear your thoughts on “the line” of anti war beliefs. when is the able bodied public meant to volunteer? when are the professionals meant to shift all focus to solving or stopping conflict? And most importantly— what can academics /do/ to preserve or change during conflict?  \n",

I mean no disrespect to the Queen, I think she was impressive in many ways, I just don’t find the monarchy interesting and I don’t want to hear about it endlessly.  \n",

But to your point about something going on about world solidarity and citizen's trust about institutions as a guardrail to their well being is indeed in dangerous jeopardy amongst western democracies. Something definitely worrisome is happening but as you said, we don't quite know what it is.. ?  \n",

I would highly recommend, the presentation and voice of the narrator is top notch\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/FallofCivilizationsPodcast  \n",
       "119  Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless. It was unfair, too, in that it reduced her to a ridiculous caricature of the \"problem white woman\" without any investigation into who she was, as a person.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess that all this is to say that we suffer from the same disease, over here. There are some differences, in terms of progression, but our current version of the right and some of our left is completely infected, or so it seems to me. And that is to my considerable dismay... because yea, Canada is a bit special. How many countries work for decades, even up to centuries, to build an intentional dream of inclusion like that?

Hers is an extraordinary history. There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here. As well as mention that the BBC, a great institution that in many ways is vulnerable and at risk, is doing a fantastic job with coverage today.  \n",

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit. We've descended into the \"so, you think you're better than me?\" society where so much means so little to so many.\\n\\nOne question, Vlad, if I may? You used the phrase 'our culture' and all citizens -- do you think there is a shared single culture, even shared values in Britain today? Was that a generalisation? It's just not what I have found in 52 years, sadly.  \n",

Out of curiosity he went to a music hall, in South London. The theatre was full to capacity, the audience largely from the poorer classes. They were singing all the old songs and laughing along in good spirits. He had wondered how an unprepared democracy could resist a totalitarian state. In that moment he realised why they had prevailed . The sense of good hearted solidarity, struck him as a young communist and he made his home here.  \n",

Even the concept of \"important national leaders\" seems strange to me. If you ask me who our head of state is, I always have to think for a second or two which one of the seven members of the federal council it is. Because they take turn every year. Swiss politics is boring as hell in a good way. We almost have no really disruptive power changes, no single ruling party. Also no significant losses of certain national figures, that could shake the whole country.  \n",

It’s telling when you rarely pay much attention and aren’t a royalist. But on hearing the news you feel strangely sad and unsettled. Which is why I like your conversations so much- they bring things to the fore.  \n",

The Queen for me was the perfect symbol of national unity beyond politics and the right sense of duty and political silence that is the requirement of a constitutional monarch. My proudest inheritance from my father are two plaques: his award of the Polish Virtuti Militari medal his bravery in the War and the post-war commission as a Royal Air Force officer he received from the Queen's father King George VI.\\nWith her passing I feel the huge gap of that departing generation, but I hope her loss will renew interest in a sense of duty to our civilisation which she so embodied, a move away from narcissism and a return to working for the common good. Our national anthem will or course change which will be hard to get used to.\\nNothing is immortal, we have to keep renewing the good things!  \n",

Perhaps I just don’t know the lingo to talk about it yet, but we can talk about issues that affect Black people more without this wall of identity around it. we should do things that help the Black community because they’re our neighbors and that’s what we do. and we can recognize the background. but idk— identity is important but there’s too many barriers all around us now. it’s like a maze with no corridors.  \n",

I'm sorry to see the Queen go - I'm neither an abolitionist or monarchist, I feel that the monarchy while imperfect (cloaked as it is in religiosity and so on) is as good a system as any. I think/hope we in Britain can cohere in a time of need and it would be useful for us to follow the Queen's example in a crisis; to be clearheaded and rational as opposed to being led by emotion.\\n\\nOn your wider point I think I see more and more people with a childlike level of political understanding. You don't have to scroll far through YouTube comments or the \"Have Your Say\" section on the BBC to see hackneyed or cliched political discourse. You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country. This isn't Game of Thrones, this is real life. People need to understand that - as today has proven - rich or poor, urchin or Queen, we all die in the end, and that until that happens we all need somewhere to sleep, food to eat, and our goals in life aren't that dissimilar. Maybe then we could return to some common ground.  \n",

We now live in a different world to the one I was accustoned to and I don't like it. HM her Majesty was for me and many a global symbol of virtue, value, stability, adaptability, compromise and freedom. Long live HM the Queen's memory! Long live her legacy! What an absolutely sad sad day.  \n",

Even as Americans, we can identify with the British in their ambivalence about the institution of the monarchy. And, we are watching as you go through this time and try to sort this out.

Thank you  thank you  thank you \\nIn my opinion, Her Majesty was the sole definition of grace, her honorable behavior was almost flawless and I’ve always admired her ability to stay true to herself, and I think the speech she made to the nation when she was only 21 years old is very telling of the kind of person she was.\\nAnd I can be wrong but I believe she never gave any interviews, her weekly briefings with the 15 different prime minister’s during her reign, who always was unofficial - no notes - no personal opinion never leaked. I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace   \n",

The gradual degradation of the average persons apparent awareness and/or participation in any sense of civic belonging. Any positive regard or expression of being a part of a nation, of something greater, a narrative, dying or gasping for air. Fast approaching 30, I genuinely feel untethered from the world of my youth and upbringing. So much has changed, so quickly. For context, i’m a lower middle class Australian.  \n",

In time we'll be ok, because she hasn't left us as defenceless children, but there is going to be a journey across the desert. God save the King.  \n",

There is this vision of stabilty she personified based on centuries of history and based on her actions and behaviour. In that regard, she was deifinitely a stabilizing force in symbol, but at the same time, an anachronism. I'm in Canada and she's part of tradition and the Queen of Canada, but at the same time, representative of something that is so foreign in this country. I'm not sure if the idea of a 'republic' is any answer, as that will come up in the coming weeks I'm sure. Would it be better or just a renaming of heirarchical structures? Is there really a difference? \\n\\nI grew up singing God Save the Queen in public school, then suddenly not.  \n",

Should we be optimistic or rather pessimistic about the (already happening) changes in the western societies? Word \"crisis\" paired with anything brings negative connotations but also some kind of hope that things may be improved afterwards, an unstable world may become stable again. Or maybe the (ongoing) crisis is just a new form of existence of the western world, with no perspective of happy end?  \n",

She was, he said , a moral code,  a guiding light on how to behave. If ever we badly needed a guiding light, it is now.  \n",

My main impression is that there's a disconnect between the beliefs and the feelings, at least for me.\\n\\nI take for granted that institutions have limited competence; that regulatory capture is a real and significant phenomenon, especially in areas such as financial regulation; that I'm not a major donor, nor a swing voter, nor registered in a swing state or district, nor socially linked to a large number of people I could influence, and that I therefore have, if not zero influence, at least substantially less influence on policymakers than my numerical position as one citizen among 300,000,000+ would suggest; and that an adequate understanding of the behavior of institutions would require an as-yet undeveloped collection of theory and data, like economics only harder.  But somehow, I do not feel that set of beliefs emotionally, nor do act on it.  I still participate in the liturgy of democracy, despite not believing the creed.  I write to my elected representatives.  I sometimes go to campaign events during the primaries, and speak to the candidate if I get the chance.  I go to my polling place every election day, speak to the people outside with signs and pamphlets, and listen with particular attention to races where I'm not thoroughly decided.  I thank them for being there.  I vote.  \n",

They NEVER call her that. Good video. I think this throws the future of the monarchy in to significant jeopardy. The current PM at one point in her career of political flip-flopping, advocated for the abolishment of the monarchy. I'm not a pro-monarchy type guy at all but I appreciate the notion that the Queen was a symbol for unification. I personally am not sure Charles will ever be able to earn the trust or respect that his mother had.  And the following generation of royals are little more than minor celebrities at this point. Irrespective of public opinion I think it is fair to say the Royal family has done quite well at diluting its own significance. So yes, interesting times ahead.  \n",

As ever, a joy to listen to.   Can you develop the phrase \"anti-solidarity propaganda\" a little further?   I'm interested to know whether your view is that this propaganda is different from propaganda of the sort described by Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (for example), and if so, in what way(s). \\nAs always, a pleasure to listen to - thank you.     .  \n",

Yeah, in a while - there's a visceral component in play at the moment. We lost our horsey girl, and the wilderness loving walker. Many are saying; The last respectable royal has passed. I have issue with a lot of things about the monarchy - and spent half my life in different countries that I have happily called home, but this still hurts.

I do wonder if the UK royal family can survive or become some fancy Kardashian family...  \n",

Until we return to viewing others as individuals, and not just members of arbitrarily - and artificially - defined groups, we will make no progress toward solidarity.  \n",

The components of the construct that yielded its artistic effect, its inclusions, exclusions, emphases, neglects, patches, replacements, re-thinkings, betrayals, vindications,  and, yes, its susceptibilities to wrongful exploitation, have been pitilessly disclosed. \\nThe disclosures have been emerging throughout the epoch, some slowly and some suddenly over the duration. Still, the connection has more or less held up between it and the realities which it has interpreted for us. \\nI hope we can fashion some new tools or instruments or strategies that can disclose some factors of the succeeding circumstances that can be useful for fashioning a new solidarity that people can share on a wider scale than is offered at present. And I hope that what is to come can counter the decline which we are manifestly experiencing now. \\nBut, as you suggest, pining for the restoration of some version of the older settlement is, understandably but nevertheless truthfully, only nostalgia.  \n",

Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.  \n",

I can't immediately recall any UK politicians arguing from the principle you mention for example. \\n\\nRegarding hidden intents behind the FSB's explanation for Daria's murder, I find thinking about and searching for such hidden intents can be quite wearing on the brain, don't you? I suppose it is an instance of psychosocial warfare after all (is that a word?!). BTW, I've heard it claimed that the level of suspicion of others necessary to be successfully self-employed over a lifetime can contribute to the risk of dementia symptoms!  \n",

For me, it is about self-entitlement, both on the so called left and right.  With self-entitlement comes uncritical political certainty, isolation and ultimately, alienation. For example, at one time I could read the Guardian and the Telegraph and the only major difference was the editorial page. Now it seems that they are written by different species. I can't read either.  \n",

But I've been watching many of the recent events surrounding the death of the Queen. The protocols, the processes, in an attempt to understand the meaning of the traditions and the reactions of the people in the Realms where she carried soft power. We have no one to compare her to in the US.\\n     I observed the removal and replacement of the person serving in their highest political position. All the fights between political parties with their strongly held opposing views. I compared that to how we in America deal with our own political party battles. Battles which seem to have eliminated all sense of unity in our citizens. Nothing is holding us together as one Nation.\\n     Two days before the Queen's death she performed her last official act by the ceremony to sanctify the transition of power on to their newly elected Prime Minister. No fighting about the results. No protests. No Coup attempts. \\n     When Queen Elizabeth died the Countries, the Commonwealth, all who were under her care, came together to mourn. Obviously some people felt more deeply emotional than others. But there was not one report of any group who felt relief that she had passed. She was THEIR Queen!\\n     In America we have nothing that holds our heart and soul together like their Sovereign does for them.  A \"Leading Family\" they, consciously or not, do turn to for stability. An imperfect family with flaws and talents they can be criticized or praised. But they are loved.\\n    The English Monarchy is bound by established Royal constraints, traditions and pomp and circumstance that has no political agenda. They have no control over agendas that affect the daily lives of the citizens. \\n     Working Royals spend their lives on bringing their people together. And importantly representing them with their respected titles for Great Britain as Ambassadors to the World  \\n     We have nothing to offer the World with that highest level of Ambassadorship. We have no one that could bring us together, putting aside every political bias, in order to honor them. \\n     It makes for an interesting and  valid argument for the necessity of Royalty in a Country. Though it would be impossible for the US to establish a Royal Family here.\\n     I just had this realization since the Queen's death was announced and I was quite surprised how it readjusted some of my American beliefs. And our needs. The Constitution was supposed to be what we all came together to agreed upon. \\n     But it's now shaking with all the attacks from the Republican Party. And would crumble completely if Trump went back into office.

This will have a psychological effect. \\n\\nHaving watched The Queen it has become clear to me what a social adhesive the royal institution is in the UK. Not great that the new king is a lot less popular. Maybe it would have been better if it was William.  \n",

It’s hard to talk about this fear without feeling like i’m contributing to paranoia, though. I have been thinking about my duty to freedom and liberty, and where i draw the line before i feel i need to act. I was listening to leftist folk singer Pete Seeger, who originally opposed american participation in fighting the Nazis. “Roosevelt told the people how he felt… I hate war and so does elanor but we won’t be safe til everybody’s dead”. And for the most part, in most wars. I agree. But not in fighting the reich. that was an all hands on deck job. Or— if a civil war were to break out, as some think, when would I feel it important to upkeep democracy? I would love to hear your thoughts on “the line” of anti war beliefs. when is the able bodied public meant to volunteer? when are the professionals meant to shift all focus to solving or stopping conflict? And most importantly— what can academics /do/ to preserve or change during conflict?  \n",

I mean no disrespect to the Queen, I think she was impressive in many ways, I just don’t find the monarchy interesting and I don’t want to hear about it endlessly.  \n",

But to your point about something going on about world solidarity and citizen's trust about institutions as a guardrail to their well being is indeed in dangerous jeopardy amongst western democracies. Something definitely worrisome is happening but as you said, we don't quite know what it is.. ?  \n",

I would highly recommend, the presentation and voice of the narrator is top notch\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/FallofCivilizationsPodcast  \n",
       "179  Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless. It was unfair, too, in that it reduced her to a ridiculous caricature of the \"problem white woman\" without any investigation into who she was, as a person.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess that all this is to say that we suffer from the same disease, over here. There are some differences, in terms of progression, but our current version of the right and some of our left is completely infected, or so it seems to me. And that is to my considerable dismay... because yea, Canada is a bit special. How many countries work for decades, even up to centuries, to build an intentional dream of inclusion like that?

Society has always been a top-down affair. 'Solidarity' is just a rationalization to take the sting out of what is at the end of the day a master-slave relationship between the masses and their elites.  And now we understand this.\\n\\nI think we've reached the end of the road for society.  Not this or that specific configuration of society, but the concept of society in general.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Liberalism and popular education have taught the masses to see themselves as political actors, shown us how the sausage is made.  There's no way for us to 'unsee' this.  We will never again be able to recapture this feeling of political 'legitimacy'.  \n",

Breath of fresh air after having a leader that reveled in enthusiastically dividing thru dog-whistling and bullying for 4 years.  Seems at least tangentially related to what you're talking about.\\n\\nI also cannot help but think of Tucker Carlson's fan-fic for the January 6th insurrection called \"Patriot Purge\" where he posits the entire event was an inside job to provide an excuse to arrest \"Patriots\".   As far as putting forth an absurd story to see what benefits will be accrued.  \n",

I do have to admit though that as Im getting older (I think me and Vlad are of the same age), I tend to appreciate the experience that some figures like Queen Elizabeth have gathered over the years. Im ready to condemn the royal families as blood suckers that are payed by the state the equivallent amount that would support a small town, and then I look at people like Liz Truss making it to the PM chair and Im thinking, ''at least Elizabeth was not a ridiculous and brainless cardboard piece with the vague shape of authority''. \\nThe question imo is not about solidarity and no, the Russian/Ukrainian war is not as important as most of the media and influencers (you included, no offence) are trying to convince us that it is. The real question is, what do you do, when you feel that you are not represented by your state. When you clearly see that the government is not acting according to the majority's wishes but takes advantage of the green light that an election 2 or 3 years ago gave them, and commits you into actions that will affect all of your life, the life of your children and possibly the life of your grand children. What do you do when even the opposition does not come to the speaker's stand in the parliament and ask ''wait a minute, WHY are we doing this?'', but react as if a higher and external power dictates a set of rules and we either follow (and completely destroy our lives) or we are in danger of being ousted of the ''cool kids club'' and get destroyed by canceling anyway. \\nThis is not about Democracy (that we dont have any way), about solidarity or political culture. Its about plain feudal (or mafia if you like) tactics.  \n",

In Buddhist philosophy there is a middle way: Nothing is ultimately real, yet everything you do relatively matters. Nihilism and Realism are seen to be extremes to be avoided. In Buddhist philosophy it’s called: Differentiating the middle from the extremes, or The Middle Way philosophy.

With the continuous onslaught of misinformation, for example, a media article has a picture of a black cat but continuously insists it's a white cat in the writing. The majority of people reading the article would agree it's a black cat by observing the factual evidence of the picture. But a minority would agree it's a white cat upon the insistence of the article saying it's a white cat. The majority has to accommodate the minority by agreeing it's a white cat to bring them into the solidarity of the majority. The minority however doesn't believe the majority generally believes it's a white cat so it creates mistrust and persuades some of the majority to mistrust the solidarity of the majority.

Hers is an extraordinary history. There is a special and moving way in which she understood that minimalism was a virtue in her role. I appreciate that an analytical video about our politics may not be right to watch for many at this time. So I just want to put that warning here. As well as mention that the BBC, a great institution that in many ways is vulnerable and at risk, is doing a fantastic job with coverage today.  \n",

Her sense of duty was something that has to be admired and deserves the highest respect. I think with her passing we will see she was the last link we had to a Britain of the past. People's values and behaviour have changed so much and I don't think any of it has been to anyone's benefit. We've descended into the \"so, you think you're better than me?\" society where so much means so little to so many.\\n\\nOne question, Vlad, if I may? You used the phrase 'our culture' and all citizens -- do you think there is a shared single culture, even shared values in Britain today? Was that a generalisation? It's just not what I have found in 52 years, sadly.  \n",

Out of curiosity he went to a music hall, in South London. The theatre was full to capacity, the audience largely from the poorer classes. They were singing all the old songs and laughing along in good spirits. He had wondered how an unprepared democracy could resist a totalitarian state. In that moment he realised why they had prevailed . The sense of good hearted solidarity, struck him as a young communist and he made his home here.  \n",

Even the concept of \"important national leaders\" seems strange to me. If you ask me who our head of state is, I always have to think for a second or two which one of the seven members of the federal council it is. Because they take turn every year. Swiss politics is boring as hell in a good way. We almost have no really disruptive power changes, no single ruling party. Also no significant losses of certain national figures, that could shake the whole country.  \n",

It’s telling when you rarely pay much attention and aren’t a royalist. But on hearing the news you feel strangely sad and unsettled. Which is why I like your conversations so much- they bring things to the fore.  \n",

The Queen for me was the perfect symbol of national unity beyond politics and the right sense of duty and political silence that is the requirement of a constitutional monarch. My proudest inheritance from my father are two plaques: his award of the Polish Virtuti Militari medal his bravery in the War and the post-war commission as a Royal Air Force officer he received from the Queen's father King George VI.\\nWith her passing I feel the huge gap of that departing generation, but I hope her loss will renew interest in a sense of duty to our civilisation which she so embodied, a move away from narcissism and a return to working for the common good. Our national anthem will or course change which will be hard to get used to.\\nNothing is immortal, we have to keep renewing the good things!  \n",

Perhaps I just don’t know the lingo to talk about it yet, but we can talk about issues that affect Black people more without this wall of identity around it. we should do things that help the Black community because they’re our neighbors and that’s what we do. and we can recognize the background. but idk— identity is important but there’s too many barriers all around us now. it’s like a maze with no corridors.  \n",

I'm sorry to see the Queen go - I'm neither an abolitionist or monarchist, I feel that the monarchy while imperfect (cloaked as it is in religiosity and so on) is as good a system as any. I think/hope we in Britain can cohere in a time of need and it would be useful for us to follow the Queen's example in a crisis; to be clearheaded and rational as opposed to being led by emotion.\\n\\nOn your wider point I think I see more and more people with a childlike level of political understanding. You don't have to scroll far through YouTube comments or the \"Have Your Say\" section on the BBC to see hackneyed or cliched political discourse. You know the sort of thing - the Tories are only interested in helping their \"rich CEO friends\" or Labour want to draw and quarter every bourgeois they can lay hands upon and hang their steaming entrails on the tower of London. Anyone in political life is presented as a comic book villain and there's little or no understanding that the world isn't really like that.\\n\\nI think we need an adult to gently explain to people that, believe it or not, the vast majority of people in public life are there because they genuinely want to contribute towards the advancement of our society such that the maximum number are able to ascend the maximum height up their hierarchy of needs, and that the disagreements in politics are bona fide, between individuals who are political adversaries but public service colleagues, about how best we procure and marshal resources to do so.\\n\\nA good friend of mine remarked that he couldn't believe he saw Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer talking good naturedly in Parliament and that they should hate each other, and the fact that they did was evidence of some corruption or malpractice, and I think my friend might unfortunately be characteristic of the rest of the country. This isn't Game of Thrones, this is real life. People need to understand that - as today has proven - rich or poor, urchin or Queen, we all die in the end, and that until that happens we all need somewhere to sleep, food to eat, and our goals in life aren't that dissimilar. Maybe then we could return to some common ground.  \n",

We now live in a different world to the one I was accustoned to and I don't like it. HM her Majesty was for me and many a global symbol of virtue, value, stability, adaptability, compromise and freedom. Long live HM the Queen's memory! Long live her legacy! What an absolutely sad sad day.  \n",

Even as Americans, we can identify with the British in their ambivalence about the institution of the monarchy. And, we are watching as you go through this time and try to sort this out.

Thank you  thank you  thank you \\nIn my opinion, Her Majesty was the sole definition of grace, her honorable behavior was almost flawless and I’ve always admired her ability to stay true to herself, and I think the speech she made to the nation when she was only 21 years old is very telling of the kind of person she was.\\nAnd I can be wrong but I believe she never gave any interviews, her weekly briefings with the 15 different prime minister’s during her reign, who always was unofficial - no notes - no personal opinion never leaked. I respect her consistency, her ability to separate herself from her private self and her public self. #StiffUpperLip\\n#StiffenYourUpperLip \\nWith kindness and respect, Grace   \n",

The gradual degradation of the average persons apparent awareness and/or participation in any sense of civic belonging. Any positive regard or expression of being a part of a nation, of something greater, a narrative, dying or gasping for air. Fast approaching 30, I genuinely feel untethered from the world of my youth and upbringing. So much has changed, so quickly. For context, i’m a lower middle class Australian.  \n",

In time we'll be ok, because she hasn't left us as defenceless children, but there is going to be a journey across the desert. God save the King.  \n",

There is this vision of stabilty she personified based on centuries of history and based on her actions and behaviour. In that regard, she was deifinitely a stabilizing force in symbol, but at the same time, an anachronism. I'm in Canada and she's part of tradition and the Queen of Canada, but at the same time, representative of something that is so foreign in this country. I'm not sure if the idea of a 'republic' is any answer, as that will come up in the coming weeks I'm sure. Would it be better or just a renaming of heirarchical structures? Is there really a difference? \\n\\nI grew up singing God Save the Queen in public school, then suddenly not.  \n",

Should we be optimistic or rather pessimistic about the (already happening) changes in the western societies? Word \"crisis\" paired with anything brings negative connotations but also some kind of hope that things may be improved afterwards, an unstable world may become stable again. Or maybe the (ongoing) crisis is just a new form of existence of the western world, with no perspective of happy end?  \n",

She was, he said , a moral code,  a guiding light on how to behave. If ever we badly needed a guiding light, it is now.  \n",

My main impression is that there's a disconnect between the beliefs and the feelings, at least for me.\\n\\nI take for granted that institutions have limited competence; that regulatory capture is a real and significant phenomenon, especially in areas such as financial regulation; that I'm not a major donor, nor a swing voter, nor registered in a swing state or district, nor socially linked to a large number of people I could influence, and that I therefore have, if not zero influence, at least substantially less influence on policymakers than my numerical position as one citizen among 300,000,000+ would suggest; and that an adequate understanding of the behavior of institutions would require an as-yet undeveloped collection of theory and data, like economics only harder.  But somehow, I do not feel that set of beliefs emotionally, nor do act on it.  I still participate in the liturgy of democracy, despite not believing the creed.  I write to my elected representatives.  I sometimes go to campaign events during the primaries, and speak to the candidate if I get the chance.  I go to my polling place every election day, speak to the people outside with signs and pamphlets, and listen with particular attention to races where I'm not thoroughly decided.  I thank them for being there.  I vote.  \n",

They NEVER call her that. Good video. I think this throws the future of the monarchy in to significant jeopardy. The current PM at one point in her career of political flip-flopping, advocated for the abolishment of the monarchy. I'm not a pro-monarchy type guy at all but I appreciate the notion that the Queen was a symbol for unification. I personally am not sure Charles will ever be able to earn the trust or respect that his mother had.  And the following generation of royals are little more than minor celebrities at this point. Irrespective of public opinion I think it is fair to say the Royal family has done quite well at diluting its own significance. So yes, interesting times ahead.  \n",

As ever, a joy to listen to.   Can you develop the phrase \"anti-solidarity propaganda\" a little further?   I'm interested to know whether your view is that this propaganda is different from propaganda of the sort described by Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism (for example), and if so, in what way(s). \\nAs always, a pleasure to listen to - thank you.     .  \n",

Yeah, in a while - there's a visceral component in play at the moment. We lost our horsey girl, and the wilderness loving walker. Many are saying; The last respectable royal has passed. I have issue with a lot of things about the monarchy - and spent half my life in different countries that I have happily called home, but this still hurts.

I do wonder if the UK royal family can survive or become some fancy Kardashian family...  \n",

Until we return to viewing others as individuals, and not just members of arbitrarily - and artificially - defined groups, we will make no progress toward solidarity.  \n",

The components of the construct that yielded its artistic effect, its inclusions, exclusions, emphases, neglects, patches, replacements, re-thinkings, betrayals, vindications,  and, yes, its susceptibilities to wrongful exploitation, have been pitilessly disclosed. \\nThe disclosures have been emerging throughout the epoch, some slowly and some suddenly over the duration. Still, the connection has more or less held up between it and the realities which it has interpreted for us. \\nI hope we can fashion some new tools or instruments or strategies that can disclose some factors of the succeeding circumstances that can be useful for fashioning a new solidarity that people can share on a wider scale than is offered at present. And I hope that what is to come can counter the decline which we are manifestly experiencing now. \\nBut, as you suggest, pining for the restoration of some version of the older settlement is, understandably but nevertheless truthfully, only nostalgia.  \n",

Famously Benedict Anderson characterized  nations as \"imagined communities\". The Head of State in a nation acts as a symbolic figurehead - whether a non-executive president such as Ireland's or a monarch as in the UK. Monarchy has the disadvantages of being based on arbitrary genetics of a Royal Family in contrast to electing a person with a tested track record of appreciated social virtue. This means for a monarchy that, in this case, over 70 years of rule some inevitable dynamics of an extended family life did intermittently  threaten to overwhelm life long constitutional responsibilities. Several crises cropped up. But if the role can be sustained  and made effective the sense of continuity and historical grounded-ness is a profound asset. The imagination of the citizen/subject is vivified by the weight of historic symbolism in the monarch's person. Queen Elizabeth made great use of this almost infinitely signifying resource at her disposal. it far exceeds in weight of legitimacy any non-executive president's \"aura\" residing  in a fixed term of office. The Queen's use of her \"majesty\" was pivotal in smoothing the dangerous process of dismantling the British Empire by giving it a benign landing place as \"Commonwealth\" - a transitional state allowing for republican independence as a further end state. So the sequence is colony, then overseas territory, independent Commonwealth realm; Commonwealth republic. I am very aware of the risks of violence in dismantling an imperial system. When the process malfunctions or when reactionary impulses from Government exacerbates independence movements into armed resistance: in Malaya, Suez, Kenya, Aden, Cyprus. Nevertheless, on balance, I'd say the monarchy's facilitation of the decolonization process rendered it remarkably peaceful considering the huge size of this project. There was no Dien Bien Phu or Algerian War. South Africa opted out early on, then Rhodesia.. Starting with decolonization, the institution of monarchy in Britain has shown itself to be flexibly adept at self-reinvention. I see no reason to think it won't  survive the death of Elizabeth. Domestically, the triadic interaction of Monarchy, Judiciary and Parliament resisted in the end the great pressure to disrupt its boundaries when Boris Johnson attempted to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent votes in the democratic assembly by opponents of a hard Brexit. This populist invocation of a \"tyranny of the majority \" in a referendum (as in Mill) - his very un-British invocation of a reified \"Will of the People\" (as in , say, Rousseau but not Locke) in th end failed. In Britain constitutional reform is long overdue - we need an elected second chamber. But the Monarchy in one form or another is very likely to remain - even with a separated Scotland. It is a brake upon the nihilism we experience in a divisive  \"populist\" politics  mobilizing citizens with slogans and fears of loss of identity. Sowing the seeds of distrust within the imagined community - the imaginary space of solidarity.  \n",

I can't immediately recall any UK politicians arguing from the principle you mention for example. \\n\\nRegarding hidden intents behind the FSB's explanation for Daria's murder, I find thinking about and searching for such hidden intents can be quite wearing on the brain, don't you? I suppose it is an instance of psychosocial warfare after all (is that a word?!). BTW, I've heard it claimed that the level of suspicion of others necessary to be successfully self-employed over a lifetime can contribute to the risk of dementia symptoms!  \n",

For me, it is about self-entitlement, both on the so called left and right.  With self-entitlement comes uncritical political certainty, isolation and ultimately, alienation. For example, at one time I could read the Guardian and the Telegraph and the only major difference was the editorial page. Now it seems that they are written by different species. I can't read either.  \n",

But I've been watching many of the recent events surrounding the death of the Queen. The protocols, the processes, in an attempt to understand the meaning of the traditions and the reactions of the people in the Realms where she carried soft power. We have no one to compare her to in the US.\\n     I observed the removal and replacement of the person serving in their highest political position. All the fights between political parties with their strongly held opposing views. I compared that to how we in America deal with our own political party battles. Battles which seem to have eliminated all sense of unity in our citizens. Nothing is holding us together as one Nation.\\n     Two days before the Queen's death she performed her last official act by the ceremony to sanctify the transition of power on to their newly elected Prime Minister. No fighting about the results. No protests. No Coup attempts. \\n     When Queen Elizabeth died the Countries, the Commonwealth, all who were under her care, came together to mourn. Obviously some people felt more deeply emotional than others. But there was not one report of any group who felt relief that she had passed. She was THEIR Queen!\\n     In America we have nothing that holds our heart and soul together like their Sovereign does for them.  A \"Leading Family\" they, consciously or not, do turn to for stability. An imperfect family with flaws and talents they can be criticized or praised. But they are loved.\\n    The English Monarchy is bound by established Royal constraints, traditions and pomp and circumstance that has no political agenda. They have no control over agendas that affect the daily lives of the citizens. \\n     Working Royals spend their lives on bringing their people together. And importantly representing them with their respected titles for Great Britain as Ambassadors to the World  \\n     We have nothing to offer the World with that highest level of Ambassadorship. We have no one that could bring us together, putting aside every political bias, in order to honor them. \\n     It makes for an interesting and  valid argument for the necessity of Royalty in a Country. Though it would be impossible for the US to establish a Royal Family here.\\n     I just had this realization since the Queen's death was announced and I was quite surprised how it readjusted some of my American beliefs. And our needs. The Constitution was supposed to be what we all came together to agreed upon. \\n     But it's now shaking with all the attacks from the Republican Party. And would crumble completely if Trump went back into office.

This will have a psychological effect. \\n\\nHaving watched The Queen it has become clear to me what a social adhesive the royal institution is in the UK. Not great that the new king is a lot less popular. Maybe it would have been better if it was William.  \n",

It’s hard to talk about this fear without feeling like i’m contributing to paranoia, though. I have been thinking about my duty to freedom and liberty, and where i draw the line before i feel i need to act. I was listening to leftist folk singer Pete Seeger, who originally opposed american participation in fighting the Nazis. “Roosevelt told the people how he felt… I hate war and so does elanor but we won’t be safe til everybody’s dead”. And for the most part, in most wars. I agree. But not in fighting the reich. that was an all hands on deck job. Or— if a civil war were to break out, as some think, when would I feel it important to upkeep democracy? I would love to hear your thoughts on “the line” of anti war beliefs. when is the able bodied public meant to volunteer? when are the professionals meant to shift all focus to solving or stopping conflict? And most importantly— what can academics /do/ to preserve or change during conflict?  \n",

I mean no disrespect to the Queen, I think she was impressive in many ways, I just don’t find the monarchy interesting and I don’t want to hear about it endlessly.  \n",

But to your point about something going on about world solidarity and citizen's trust about institutions as a guardrail to their well being is indeed in dangerous jeopardy amongst western democracies. Something definitely worrisome is happening but as you said, we don't quite know what it is.. ?  \n",

I would highly recommend, the presentation and voice of the narrator is top notch\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/FallofCivilizationsPodcast  \n",
       "259  Your discussion made me think of our CBC, here in Canada. It's an ancient (in Canadian terms) institution that did very much to bring all corners of this vast and patchwork country together into a sense of common understanding, identity, implication and connection. From the beginning, it was mandated to both reflect national diversity and promote national inclusion, and it had to be broadcast in every place where people happened to live, even in the far northern tundra. For decades it was the only connection to the rest of the world, for many of us.\\n\\nI love the CBC, and to this day I find that it upholds a standard of journalistic integrity and objectivity that is disappearing in all other quarters. Its reportage is often infused deeply with humanity and empathy, too, and that is non-existent in other quarters. The CBC really does still help us to understand each other.\\n\\nI wrote about it in a uni course when I realized that it had activated a cognitive bias in me - the \"my-side bias\". That happened because the much beloved senior anchor was so impartial, so unbiased, so extraordinarily fair and yet also so generous in his moderation of political discussion panels that my jaw dropped when I learned he was a card carrying Progressive-Conservative (now defunct federal conservative party). \\n\\nBecause I liked and admired him so much, I assumed that he shared my political values. Yet this was an illusion. To me, the mere fact that I made this assumption without realizing I was wrong is great testament to the CBC's journalistic integrity and success in the fulfillment of its nation-building mission. The care-full-y crafted persona that he inhabited, when he was in his role of anchor or moderator, was so thoughtful and heartfelt that I felt personally connected to him. Then through him, I felt connected to all these other people that were invited to speak on the platform that he moderated, regardless of how different they really were from me. He was very effective at fulfilling the role of the CBC, which was to bring us together in understanding - even if we are so vast a country that we might never really meet.\\n\\nThis was an online course where we got to review other students' writings, and I was shocked to see how much my conservative classmates hated the CBC. They've gotten much more hateful of it in recent years. It has gotten to the point where no candidate for the newest iteration of the conservative party (much more extreme than the last one) can get any traction unless they promise to completely defund the CBC.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another of my favourite anchors was recently made to resign from the CBC because she used the n-word. While I completely agree that white people just ought not utter this word for the sole reason of its pure injuriousness due to the history that is automatically loaded into it, not to mention the memory of the power imbalance that is invoked when it issues from one set of lips, as opposed to another one, I just couldn't imagine any circumstances under which this adorably sweet, empathetic and sharp-minded political-cultural wit of a person would use the word, so I sent a supportive message to the CBC that asked for them to share more information.\\n\\nIt turned out that she uttered the word because it is part of the title of a very controversial and yet very seminal book that marked a particular turning point in our two solitudes (French vs English) political and cultural dialogue/dialectic called White N*****s of America by Pierre Vallières. So she got force-resigned for talking about who we are without completely complying with the new expectations about how we talk about who we are.\\n\\nI have very mixed feelings about this, especially because of how much and how instantly she was hated by so many people. I agree that her speaking this word was thoughtless, but I think that what followed was even more thoughtless. It was unfair, too, in that it reduced her to a ridiculous caricature of the \"problem white woman\" without any investigation into who she was, as a person.\\n\\nAnyway, I guess that all this is to say that we suffer from the same disease, over here. There are some differences, in terms of progression, but our current version of the right and some of our left is completely infected, or so it seems to me. And that is to my considerable dismay... because yea, Canada is a bit special. How many countries work for decades, even up to centuries, to build an intentional dream of inclusion like that?

Society has always been a top-down affair. 'Solidarity' is just a rationalization to take the sting out of what is at the end of the day a master-slave relationship between the masses and their elites.  And now we understand this.\\n\\nI think we've reached the end of the road for society.  Not this or that specific configuration of society, but the concept of society in general.  The genie is out of the bottle.  Liberalism and popular education have taught the masses to see themselves as political actors, shown us how the sausage is made.  There's no way for us to 'unsee' this.  We will never again be able to recapture this feeling of political 'legitimacy'.  \n",

Breath of fresh air after having a leader that reveled in enthusiastically dividing thru dog-whistling and bullying for 4 years.  Seems at least tangentially related to what you're talking about.\\n\\nI also cannot help but think of Tucker Carlson's fan-fic for the January 6th insurrection called \"Patriot Purge\" where he posits the entire event was an inside job to provide an excuse to arrest \"Patriots\".   As far as putting forth an absurd story to see what benefits will be accrued.  \n",

I do have to admit though that as Im getting older (I think me and Vlad are of the same age), I tend to appreciate the experience that some figures like Queen Elizabeth have gathered over the years. Im ready to condemn the royal families as blood suckers that are payed by the state the equivallent amount that would support a small town, and then I look at people like Liz Truss making it to the PM chair and Im thinking, ''at least Elizabeth was not a ridiculous and brainless cardboard piece with the vague shape of authority''. \\nThe question imo is not about solidarity and no, the Russian/Ukrainian war is not as important as most of the media and influencers (you included, no offence) are trying to convince us that it is. The real question is, what do you do, when you feel that you are not represented by your state. When you clearly see that the government is not acting according to the majority's wishes but takes advantage of the green light that an election 2 or 3 years ago gave them, and commits you into actions that will affect all of your life, the life of your children and possibly the life of your grand children. What do you do when even the opposition does not come to the speaker's stand in the parliament and ask ''wait a minute, WHY are we doing this?'', but react as if a higher and external power dictates a set of rules and we either follow (and completely destroy our lives) or we are in danger of being ousted of the ''cool kids club'' and get destroyed by canceling anyway. \\nThis is not about Democracy (that we dont have any way), about solidarity or political culture. Its about plain feudal (or mafia if you like) tactics.  \n",

In Buddhist philosophy there is a middle way: Nothing is ultimately real, yet everything you do relatively matters. Nihilism and Realism are seen to be extremes to be avoided. In Buddhist philosophy it’s called: Differentiating the middle from the extremes, or The Middle Way philosophy.

With the continuous onslaught of misinformation, for example, a media article has a picture of a black cat but continuously insists it's a white cat in the writing. The majority of people reading the article would agree it's a black cat by observing the factual evidence of the picture. But a minority would agree it's a white cat upon the insistence of the article saying it's a white cat. The majority has to accommodate the minority by agreeing it's a white cat to bring them into the solidarity of the majority. The minority however doesn't believe the majority generally believes it's a white cat so it creates mistrust and persuades some of the majority to mistrust the solidarity of the majority.

We are sometimes weak-minded, subject to the ebbs and flows of ideas and rhetoric, but we know, each of us do know, that we want to work with others, to get along, because life is easier that way.  Conflict, needless emnity and mean actions are ... exhausting, fruitless and disturb and get in the way of a healthy, calm, productive life.  The culture wars are always started by right-wingers, for thousands of years they have discriminated,  persecuted and hated on this group or that.  SJWs, activists for black rights, gay rights, womens rights, etc., are ALL just a reaction to that oppression.  Many right-wingers cannot act in a civil, tolerant, understanding and accepting way - they want to force their religion, their cultural beliefs, their doctrines on us.  They aren't willing to compromise or be reasonable.  Their views are more and more in the minority, and as older people with ingrained hardline right-wing views, not shared by the youth of today, move on, the youth and middle-aged are accepting difference, embracing difference, being understanding and standing up for minorities and groups which have been sidelined and persecuted, our planet is moving towards a more peaceful state.  I think I even see this in Russia, in the men sent to fight, who never wanted to be there, in the interviews of captured Russians whose families are so releived they were captured and not blown to bits.  And I didn't even refer to Pinker !    \n",

We (Americans, French, etc) had to work pretty hard to get rid of monarchs, and I'm only sad that we were never able to finish to job. I know people are grieving. I know Elizabeth had her \"good\" moments (I guess she went shopping during WWII?).  I'm sorry but Royalty still sucks. Monarchy sucks.

Private property rights, freedom of speech and movement, local vs federal power are deeply ingrained and most Americans don't believe you can have a healthy society without them. If I don't have my own little kingdom and the right to make it thrive and to protect it then I am a serf.
